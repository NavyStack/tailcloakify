## Using a child Theme

If you want to customize this theme, by extending it with your own files to be loaded as scripts or styles you can follow the following steps.

1. [Deploy Keywind Login Theme](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#deploying-themes)
2. [Create your own Login Theme](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#creating-a-theme)
3. Specify parent theme in [theme properties](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/#theme-properties) and add additional files to be loaded in the header

```
parent=tailcloakify
scripts=first-script.js second-script.js
styles=custom-styles.css
meta=name==content name2=content2
```

# Developer Quick Start

If you want to customize the theme beyond the outlined capabilities, you can do so by forking this repository and performing manual changes yourself.

Here do you find a Quick Start, how to setup your development environment:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ALMiG-Kompressoren-GmbH/tailcloakify
  cd tailcloakify
  yarn install  # Or use an other package manager, just be sure to delete the yarn.lock if you use another package manager.
```

## Testing the Theme Locally

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Alternatively, to run the theme locally via Keycloak:

```bash
  npx keycloakify start-keycloak
```

Or you can preview the pages using the storybook:

```bash
  npm run storybook
```

## Building the theme

You need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed to build the theme (Maven >= 3.1.1, Java >= 7).  
The `mvn` command must be in the $PATH.

-   On macOS: `brew install maven`
-   On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install maven`
-   On Windows: `choco install openjdk` and `choco install maven` (Or download from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))

```bash
  npm run build-keycloak-theme
```

Note that by default Keycloakify generates multiple `.jar` files for different versions of Keycloak.

## GitHub Actions

Tailcloakify comes with a generic GitHub Actions workflow that builds the theme and publishes
the jars [as GitHub releases artifacts](https://github.com/ALMiG-Kompressoren-GmbH/tailcloakify/releases/tag/v1.1.9).  
To release a new version **just update the `package.json` version and push**.

To enable the workflow go to your fork of this repository on GitHub then navigate to:
`Settings` > `Actions` > `Workflow permissions`, select `Read and write permissions`.
